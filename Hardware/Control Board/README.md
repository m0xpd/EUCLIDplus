[This is actually a photo of the v1 Control Board. This earlier version had a different slightly footprint for C8, which is now a radial electrolytic. Also, some of the PCB tracks carrying power on the v2 version are thicker than on the V1 version, which is archived in the [v1 Control Board](https://github.com/m0xpd/EUCLIDplus/tree/main/Hardware/Control%20Board/v1%20Control%20Board) folder]

The populated (v1) Control Board is seen (from the top/component side) in the photo below. It is mounted to the Front Panel by the potentiometers and sockets mountedd on the bottom side.

Also visible in the image above are the two 1*18 0.1 inch headers which join the Main and Control boards electrically. These are female headers on the top of the Control Board (above), which mate with corresponding male headers on the bottom of the Main Board. These headers also provide sufficient mechanical mounting of the two boards for 'static' applications, but there are provided two 3mm holes to make a more robust assembly, if required.

This folder contains a KiCad [Project File (.pro)](https://github.com/m0xpd/EUCLIDplus/blob/main/Hardware/Control%20Board/Euclid%2B%20Control%20Board.kicad_pro), a [Schematic File (.sch)](https://github.com/m0xpd/EUCLIDplus/blob/main/Hardware/Control%20Board/Euclid%2B%20Control%20Board.kicad_sch) and a [PCB file (.pcb)](https://github.com/m0xpd/EUCLIDplus/blob/main/Hardware/Control%20Board/Euclid%2B%20Control%20Board.kicad_pcb).

There is also a [BoM](https://github.com/m0xpd/EUCLIDplus/blob/main/Hardware/Control%20Board/Euclid%2B%20Control%20Board%20BoM.xlsx), which is an Excel file; you will have to download the raw file and view it outside github.

A version of the schematic in graphical (svg) format is available in the [Operation](https://github.com/m0xpd/EUCLIDplus/tree/main/Operation#readme) folder
