[This is actually a photo of the v1 Control Board. This earlier version had a different slightly footprint for C8. Also, some of the PCB tracks carrying power on the v2 version have been made thicker than on the V1 version, which is archived in the [v1 Control Board](https://github.com/m0xpd/EUCLIDplus/tree/main/Hardware/Control%20Board/v1%20Control%20Board) folder]


There is a KiCad Project File (.pro), a Schematic File (.sch) and a PCB file (.pcb).

There is also a [BoM](https://github.com/m0xpd/EUCLIDplus/blob/main/Hardware/Control%20Board/Euclid%2B%20Control%20Board%20BoM.xlsx), which is an Excel file; you will have to download the raw file and view it outside github.

A version of the schematic in graphical (svg) format is available in the [Operation](https://github.com/m0xpd/EUCLIDplus/tree/main/Operation#readme) folder
