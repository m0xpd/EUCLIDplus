# Main Board
This folder contains details of the EUCLID+ Main Board.

There is a KiCad Project File (.pro), a Schematic File (.sch) and a PCB file (.pcb).

There is also a BoM which is an Excel file; you will have to download the raw file and view it outside github.

A version of the schematic in graphical (svg) format is available in the [Operation](https://github.com/m0xpd/EUCLIDplus/tree/main/Operation#readme) folder
