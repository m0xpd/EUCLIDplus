[This is actually a photo of the v1 Main Board, which had some errors on the bottom side - the project associated with this board is in the [v1 Main Board folder](https://github.com/m0xpd/EUCLIDplus/tree/main/Hardware/Main%20Board/v1%20Main%20Board) and the errors are indicated on the schematic. This v1 Main Board also does not include the footprint for C28, which was found necessary to avoid jitter on the internal oscillator signal's duty cycle.]

Here's the populated (v1) Main Board, seen from the component side:

The folder contains a KiCad [Project File (.pro)](https://github.com/m0xpd/EUCLIDplus/blob/main/Hardware/Main%20Board/Euclid%2B%20Main%20Board.kicad_pro), a [Schematic File (.sch)](https://github.com/m0xpd/EUCLIDplus/blob/main/Hardware/Main%20Board/Euclid%2B%20Main%20Board.kicad_sch) and a [PCB file (.pcb)](https://github.com/m0xpd/EUCLIDplus/blob/main/Hardware/Main%20Board/Euclid%2B%20Main%20Board.kicad_pcb).

There is also a [BoM](https://github.com/m0xpd/EUCLIDplus/blob/main/Hardware/Main%20Board/Euclid%2B%20Main%20Board%20BoM.xlsx) which is an Excel file; you will have to download the raw file and view it outside github. 

A version of the schematic in graphical (svg) format is available in the [Operation](https://github.com/m0xpd/EUCLIDplus/tree/main/Operation#readme) folder
