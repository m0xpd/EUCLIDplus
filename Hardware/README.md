# Hardware
This folder contains details of the hardware of the Euclid+ Rhythm Generator.

There is a [Front Panel](https://github.com/m0xpd/EUCLIDplus/tree/main/Hardware/Front%20Panel#readme), Defined by a KiCad project, and two PCBs - the [Main Board](https://github.com/m0xpd/EUCLIDplus/tree/main/Hardware/Main%20Board#readme) and the [Control Board](https://github.com/m0xpd/EUCLIDplus/tree/main/Hardware/Control%20Board#readme).

Schematics for the boards, as graphics, are presented in the [circuit description](https://github.com/m0xpd/EUCLIDplus/tree/main/Operation#readme) (and are available within the KiCad projects).
