# EUCLID+ in Software

This folder describes a software implementation of the principles behind EUCLID+

There is a basic coding of the EUCLID+ method in [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) here, intended to run on the [Raspberry Pi PICO[(https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/). It could easily be ported to RPi platforms, such as [EuroPi](https://allensynthesis.co.uk/modules/europi.html). 

I have also sketched a partial KiCad project showing how the code could be supported by hardware which could easily be elaborated into a module. 

The code and hardware were validated at breadboard level in a simple system, shown below:
